 * (9 points) Implement a class binary_op, derived from expr, for storing a binary operation of the form left op right,
 * where left and right are expressions (as pointers to an expr), and op is one of +, -, *, /, %.
 * You may either make binary_op a concrete class, or implement concrete classes plus_op, minus_op, etc. derived from binary_op.
